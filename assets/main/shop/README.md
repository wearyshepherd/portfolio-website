# Practicum Coffee Shop

The Practicum Coffee shop website allows visitors to learn more about the shop and options to visit or book a table.

## Project features

- Includded semantic HTML5 elements to help improve structure and user readibility.
- Used a flexbox layout for a more efficient way to include important elements of the shop.
- Ensured that all elements are positioned correctly so the viewer can find them quickly with out any distractions.
- Flat BEM was used to simplified the structure of the website.
- A custom form is included in the design to make it easier for visitors to book a table and have a better experience when visiting the shop.
- CSS animation and transform was used in the footer to catch the visitors attention and improve the design of the website.

## Plan on improving the project

It would be a good idea to update the form to included how many tables are available or advise the user if any table is available.
A preorder option would be helpful in the menu section so the user can pre-order before visiting the shop.
Allow the visitors to submit their own recipe to be featured in the recipe section in the future.
